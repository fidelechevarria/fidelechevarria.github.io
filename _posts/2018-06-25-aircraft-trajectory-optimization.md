Red Bull Air Race is an international series of air races in which competitors have to navigate a challenging obstacle course in the fastest time possible. Pilots fly individually against the clock and have to complete tight turns through a slalom course consisting of pylons, known as "Air Gates", achieving speeds of up to 420 km/h and sustained accelerations of more than 10 G.

Participant teams usually spend a significant amount of time trying to predict optimal aircraft trajectories to follow for each track, in an effort to achieve the fastest possible lap times.

In early 2018 I started working in a personal project to develop an analysis tool which enabled a temporal-space study of optimal trajectories for different race tracks.

The problem is not trivial. Letâ€™s start from the beginning.
