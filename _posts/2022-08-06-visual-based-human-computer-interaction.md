Machine learning is improving the state of the art in many fields of technology. This phenomenon enables new paradigms in day-to-day activities that will slowly make a shift in people’s lives. One of these emerging fields is visual based human-computer interaction (HCI). This field combines some interesting areas, such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, physics-based rendering, linear algebra, numerical optimization or optimal state estimation. I am passionate about many of these technologies, and therefore have taken a step in this direction by developing a desktop application for controlling the computer mouse cursor from detected face movement using a camera.

Many people are not able to use common human-computer interface devices, such as the mouse and keyboard. It is my hope that this emerging field will enable more efficient HCI methods, gradually improving the way we interact with computers. There is room for improvement, and more efficient visual based control methods and functionalities to come. Currently this app, named Insight – Mouse Controller, is exclusively available for Windows 10 or 11 operating systems in the Microsoft Store.
